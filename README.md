# DETECT: Deception Tracking Through Eye Cues Technology

> Note: This project has just been started and is mostly research as of now.

Welcome to DETECT! This project aims to revolutionize the field of deception detection by leveraging advanced gaze tracking technology. Utilizing the powerful MediaPipe framework, DETECT analyzes eye cues to offer a new dimension in understanding and interpreting human behavior.

## üìú Overview

DETECT (Deception Tracking Through Eye Cues Technology) is a cutting-edge project designed to track and analyze eye movements to assist in identifying potential deception. By triangulating the position of the iris, DETECT provides valuable insights into gaze patterns that can be indicative of truthfulness or deception.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Gaze Tracking:** Accurate triangulation of the iris location for precise gaze direction analysis.
- **MediaPipe Integration:** Harnesses the power of MediaPipe for efficient and reliable eye cue extraction.
- **Deception Insights:** Provides a foundation for further research into gaze patterns and their correlation with deceptive behavior.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To get started with DETECT, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bingKegeta/DETECT.git
   cd DETECT
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment:**
    - Using conda (recommended):
    ```bash
    conda create --name detect
    conda activate detect
    ```
   - Using venv:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```
   - Docker: üë®‚Äçüç≥üç≥
   - Others: Task will be left to the reader

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üîß Usage

1. **Run the Application (Basic):**
   - To run it with live webcam (inbuilt only as of now):
   ```bash
   python main.py --source webcam
   ```
   - To run it with a separate image:
   ```bash
   python main.py --source image --path /path/to/image
   ```
   - To run it with a separate video:
   ```bash
   python main.py --source video --path /path/to/video
   ```
   - **(Optional)** To draw a graph of the $x$ and $y$ axes of eye movement for some visuals:
   ```bash
   python main.py --source <> <--path <>> --graph
   ```

2. **Start Analyzing:**
   - The application will initiate your camera and begin tracking eye movements.
   - Use the provided interface to view and analyze gaze data.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

The following features are currently available (almost all are experimental :P):
|Feature|Description|
|-------|-----------|
|```--affine```|Use the Face normalization algorithm for possible improvement in precision|
|```--graph```|Graph the x-time and y-time plots to see the changes in real time|
|```--csv [FILENAME]```|Export the tracked eye data into a csv file for advanced analysis|
|```--csv_interval [sec]```|üö® **[Doesn't work]** Sets the time interval between each collected data point for the csv|
___
More features will be coming soon...
